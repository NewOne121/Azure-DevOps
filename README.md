# Azure-DevOps

This repository contents templates for deployment procedures according azure DevOps specifics.
It was challenging to resolve problems with variable inheritance withing the different stages of the pipeline.
So i've managed to resolve this problems using simple pythin scrips and set of yaml files wehere you can define variables.

Here you can find azure DevOps pipeline samles to build you own pipeline for deployment of microservices to AKS and Spark jobs to databricks.
Deployer for databricks was written in scala so now i'm in precess to rework it in python.
But still there are some templates available.
